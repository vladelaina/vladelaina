# Hi 👋, This is @[vladelaina](https://vladelaina.com/)<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09845430-69f0-407a-a0bf-253f381d851d" alt="cat" width="80"/>

> Code is poetry, the terminal is a canvas, and the kernel is as free as the soul. I love tinkering, fear no refactoring, and enjoy the process of starting from scratch each time. I write love letters in Nvim, track heartbeats with Git — life is like an anime series, with every season worth looking forward to.

My username "vladelaina" is a combination of two of my favorite anime protagonists' names:
> [Vladilena Milizé ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86_(novel_series))  and [Elaina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Witch:_The_Journey_of_Elaina)
